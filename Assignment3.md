# ASSIGNMENT #3 (COMPLETE) 

## Objective

- Using a Git workflow can become very confusing, especially when collaborating with others.  When doing basic tasks, the integration of Git and Visual 
Studio Code (VSC) makes things quite easy.  

- But when you start to get tripped up (maybe you made changes in the wrong branch or didn't pull changes to your branch before starting), the command line makes it
easier to fix everything becuase nothing is hidden under the hood.  

- This week you will: 
    - Get familiar with Git Hub command line  

## PREREQUISITES  
- Git bash on Windows installed 
- Git installed on Mac or Linux (should be default).

## ACTIVITY 1: 

- Perform the following activities in Git and post the commands and the results in your Markdown file for the week.  
- Ensure that your commands and output are enclosed in a code fence.

13. What is the difference between fetch and pull.  Practice using both and show the results. 
14. Make some changes in your repo and using the command line to sync those changes with your remote repo.  Show the results.  

### Branches
14. How do you view the local and the remote branches for your repositories? 
15. View the local branches and create a new branch.  Look again.  Show before and after.
