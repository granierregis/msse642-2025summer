## ACTIVITY 2: Clone the class repo and add to your VSC Workspace

- Clone the class repo so that you have a local copy of the repo.
(It is recommened that you clone the repo in the the parent directory as your personal github project)

```
git clone https://github.com/granierregis/msse642-2025summer.git
```

- Ensure that your student repo and the class repo folders are open in VSC.  Save as a VSC workspace.
- Include a screen shot showing both repos as part of the workspace.  

- Examples (only one repo included, you need two).

## ACTIVITY 3: Writing a good readme file

- Use good formatting using capabilities of Markdown (See cheats in the main README file).
- Using VSC, stage your changes, commit with a meaningful commit message, and push to your remote repo using VSC. 




# WHAT TO TURN IN

- In the Slack channel #github-project, post the link to your GitHub repo that you created above when you are done.
- Your assignment will be completed in a markdown file. 
- Name the markdown file:

```
Assignment2<Lastname>
```

- Ensure in the root directory of your repository, you have a markdown file called "README.md."  In that file, include a link to the assignment this week. 
- Example: 

```
[Assignment #X](./Assignment#<Lastname>.md)
```

- Follow the directions above to ensure that your markdown file contains everything required for the assignment
